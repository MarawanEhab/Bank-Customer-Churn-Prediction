# Bank Customer Churn Prediction 🚀
## Dataset Story 📊
This dataset contains demographic and banking-related information of customers from a bank. It includes various features that describe the customers' profiles and their banking activities. The primary objective of this dataset is to understand the customer base and predict customer churn. Customer churn refers to customers leaving the bank, and predicting it is crucial for banks to retain customers and minimize customer loss. By analyzing this dataset, we can develop a machine learning model that predicts churned customers based on different factors, which is valuable for the bank's customer retention efforts.

## Business Problem 💼
The business problem is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a bank customer will churn or not. This prediction can help the bank in implementing targeted strategies to retain customers and reduce churn rates. Understanding and predicting customer churn will enable the bank to engage with customers more effectively and maintain their trust and loyalty. 🌟

## Project Steps 🛠️
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Analyze the distribution and relationships of features in the dataset.
Visualize the data to understand the underlying patterns and correlations.
Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data transformations to ensure data quality.

### Feature Engineering 🔧
Encode categorical features to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Scale numerical features for better model performance.
Address any imbalanced data issues to ensure robust model training.

### Model Building 🤖
Build and evaluate different machine learning models to predict customer churn:

Logistic Regression
LightGBM (LGBM)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Model Evaluation 📈
Assess the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Select the best-performing model for deployment, ensuring it provides accurate and reliable predictions.

### By following these steps, we aim to create a powerful tool for the bank to retain its valuable customers and reduce churn, ultimately driving better business outcomes. 🌟💼
